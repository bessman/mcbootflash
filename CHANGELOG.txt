v6.1.0
======

API changes
-----------
- Added function mcbootflash.protocol.get_response to read response packets from serial
  in a more robust way.
- Packet.from_serial is deprecated in favor of get_response.

Bug fixes
---------
- Fixed an off-by-one error which skipped the final word within program memory range.
- Added a workaround for a bug in the bootloader where checksum calculation would fail
  close to the upper end of program memory range (fix #13).

6.0.0

Dependency changes:
- `progressbar2` is now optional (fix #11).

API changes:
- The signature of mcbootflash.Bootloader.flash has changed. The `quiet` option is
  removed, and a new `progress_callback` option is added.

CLI changes:
- Added `--version` option to display mcbootflash version string.
- If `progressbar2` is not installed, the script falls back on displaying the progress
  as just a percentage.

Bug fixes:
- All data within program memory range is now flashed. Previously, data which was part
  of a contiguous block of data was ignored if any part of the block did not fit within
  the program memory range (fix #9).

5.1.1

Bug fixes:
- Increase timeout during flash erase (#6)

  duplication.
